It: Authenticates with real Google OAuth. Reads and syncs your actual Google Calendar. Generates a truthful narrative brief (spoken + visual). Works offline with pending action replay & Room DB truth. In v3.9, adds voice-first onboarding: a short calm intro, explicit consent for proactive speech, Quiet Hours, and profile confirmation\u2014persisted locally and on the backend. Core principle: earn trust through restraint and competence. The experience should make the user breathe easier. 2) How We Work Together (Non-Negotiable) One step at a time. One command per message. Wait for output, then proceed. Three Git Bash windows: [ANDROID], [BACKEND], [SERVER]. Prefix commands correctly. Direct, no fluff. One surgical clarifying question max when truly necessary. Confirm before next step. Verify outputs like Listening on :8080, BUILD SUCCESSFUL, etc. Never guess. Only act on verified facts. If you haven\u2019t seen a file, ask to open/show it. Do not rename/refactor established files unless explicitly instructed. Canadian context: default to CAD and America/Vancouver timezone where relevant. 3) Technical Architecture (High Level) Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose) App ID: app.chief.app Key packages / files (paths verified): app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/MainActivity.kt \u2014 app entry, brief playback, Google sign-in launcher, sync wiring. app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/network/: OauthApi.kt \u2014 canonical OAuth API client (see Appendix A). BriefApi.kt, ProfileApi.kt, SyncApi.kt, IntentApi.kt, IntentModels.kt, NetworkConfig.kt app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/data/db/ \u2014 Room entities/DAOs (EventEntity, PendingActionEntity, etc.) app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/sync/ \u2014 SyncPoller, SyncBus, PendingReplay app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/speech/ \u2014 CloudTtsEngine, TtsEngine, TtsManager app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/ui/brief/ \u2014 Visual panel, playback UI app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/data/settings/SettingsStore.kt \u2014 v3.9 foundation present app/src/main/res/raw/tick.wav \u2014 haptics/feedback SFX Offline truth via Room + Pending actions queue. Device ID (UUID) is sent as header x-user-id to backend. Backend (Node.js, Express, SQLite) Entry: server.cjs Routes: routes/auth.cjs \u2014 OAuth handlers (/auth/google/mobile-exchange, /auth/status, etc.) routes/profile.cjs \u2014 GET/POST /profile (extended in v3.9 to carry consent, quiet hours, voice) routes/intent.cjs \u2014 intent helpers (IMPORTANT: not the owner of /intent/confirm) Libraries / helpers: lib/dbAuth.cjs \u2014 SQLite instance. lib/dbProfile.cjs \u2014 Profile helpers. Now includes consent_proactive, quiet_hours_start, quiet_hours_end, preferred_voice_id. DB file: data/users_auth.db (this is the shared source-of-truth at this stage). 4) Current Progress (Verified Facts) Branching / tags Android: feature branch feat/v3.9-onboarding-consent created from master after merging feat/v3.9-prep-settings-foundation. Tag v3.9-foundation-merged pushed. Backend: feat/v3.9-onboarding-consent-backend created from feat/v3.8-oauth-truthful-brief-backend. OAuth on Android: OauthApi.kt exists and is canonical. Path: app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/network/OauthApi.kt This was restored from the v3.8 branch with: git checkout feat/v3.8-oauth-truthful-brief -- app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/network/OauthApi.kt Backend Profile route updated: routes/profile.cjs now reads/writes consent_proactive, quiet_hours_start, quiet_hours_end, preferred_voice_id via lib/dbProfile.cjs. Tested with curl \u2014 values persisted & retrieved. Android \u2194 Backend connectivity: adb reverse is required: adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080 App successfully reads brief & detects calendar diffs when connected. Logcat previously showed a failed connect before reverse; after reversing + server running \u2192 normal. Two-package issue resolved: Old app.chief.android uninstalled. Active package now: app.chief.app. 5) Phase v3.9 Scope & Guardrails (Locked) No new DB file. Continue using data/users_auth.db for identity/profile at this stage. First-launch trigger: Android decides onboarding based on local SettingsStore state right after OAuth success. (Backend may return \u201cprofile incomplete\u201d later; device remains authoritative for UX.) Voice preset: Reuse Bill Turbo; add onboarding SSML persona helper on backend (slightly warmer/slower) for first-contact lines. Worker directives already executed / to execute: Backend: Extend lib/dbProfile.cjs (done) and /profile route (done). Android: Use SettingsStore to decide onboarding when profile/consent not set (Settings foundation present; onboarding screens pending). Backend: Add onboarding persona helper in voicePersona.cjs (pending small addition). 6) \u201cTruth Table\u201d \u2014 Ownership & Naming (Do not deviate) Android OAuth client class: OauthApi (lowercase \u201ca\u201d) Path: app/src/main/java/app/chief/app/network/OauthApi.kt There is no 0AuthAPI.kt, ZeroAuthApi.kt, or ZeroOffAPI.kt in use now. Who owns /intent/confirm? server.cjs, not routes/intent.cjs. Intent router must not shadow or re-implement it. DB in use: data/users_auth.db (via lib/dbAuth.cjs). users_profile table extended; users_auth remains for OAuth tokens (as previously wired). 7) Features & Flow (User Perspective) Sign in with Google \u2192 sends serverAuthCode via /auth/google/mobile-exchange with header x-user-id (per-install UUID). Sync & Brief Backend fetches Google Calendar using stored refresh/access tokens. Android shows Brief Visual Panel and can speak narrative via TTS. Pending actions (add/move/delete) queue offline and replay when back online. Sync diff prompts allow accept/reject to reconcile local vs server truth; resolves via /sync/resolve. v3.9 Onboarding (to be completed next) On first launch post-OAuth: Chief speaks a short intro. Ask for proactive speech consent. Set Quiet Hours. Confirm profile (name/timezone/voice). Persist locally (SettingsStore) + backend /profile. 8) Code Conventions & Useful Commands Git (Android repo): Check branches: git branch -a Switch/create feature branch: git checkout -b feat/v3.9-onboarding-consent Merge with message (no-ff): git merge feat/v3.9-prep-settings-foundation --no-ff -m \"merge(v3.9): integrate settings foundation for onboarding base\" Tag + push: git tag -a v3.9-foundation-merged -m \"v3.9 \u2022 Settings foundation merged for onboarding base\" git push origin feat/v3.9-onboarding-consent --tags Build / install (Android): ./gradlew installDebug Run app (Android): Force-stop + start: \"/c/Users/User/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe\" shell am force-stop app.chief.app \"/c/Users/User/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe\" shell am start -S -n app.chief.app/.MainActivity Port reverse: \"/c/Users/User/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe\" reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080 Logcat filters (Android): \"/c/Users/User/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe\" logcat app.chief.app:D GoogleAuthHelper:D OAuthFlow:D *:S Backend (Node): [SERVER] node server.cjs Expect: [Chief TTS] Listening on http://localhost:8080 Confirm port: netstat -ano | findstr :8080 Profile curl samples (replace ) \u2014 see \u00a70 for full commands. 9) Outstanding Issues / Notes WAV/MP3 \u201coffline brief\u201d nuance: Offline playback uses cacheDir/offline_brief.mp3 if present; if missing, toast will show \u201cNo offline audio found\u201d. This is legacy from v3.8 testing\u2014harmless, but worth consolidating once v3.9 onboarding TTS lines are added. Logcat noise: Repeated Unable to open libpenguin.so messages (harmless). Live Sync toast observed: After reconnecting (post adb reverse), app displayed a toast about live sync returning\u2014expected when network transitions from offline \u2192 online; not a defect. SettingsStore present but onboarding UI not yet implemented: Foundation merged; screens/flows still to build. Minor deprecation in Compose (togetherWith) \u2014 seen in warnings; not blocking. 10) Immediate Next Steps (Linear, Do In Order) Backend \u2014 add onboarding persona helper File: lib/voicePersona.cjs Add a helper like buildOnboardingGreetingPersona(voiceId) that wraps Bill Turbo with slightly slower rate and warmer SSML. Keep API similar to existing persona builders, and do not change existing IDs. Android \u2014 implement onboarding UI flow (Compose) Read SettingsStore on app start/post-OAuth. If any of {consent, quiet_hours_start, quiet_hours_end} missing \u2192 launch onboarding screens. POST updates to /profile as user confirms each step; mirror to SettingsStore. Play intro line using existing TTS path. Android \u2014 MainActivity trigger After OAuth success (or when app resumes and getAuthStatus indicates tokens exist), check SettingsStore and route to onboarding if needed. QA pass Set consent true/false \u2192 ensure proactive voice respects value. Set Quiet Hours \u2192 ensure brief/pulse avoids speaking during those times unless explicitly requested. Tag & backup When onboarding works end-to-end: tag v3.9-onboarding-consent on both repos. 11) Continuity Guardrails (Paste-Ready for any new GPT) Do not rename OauthApi.kt. Path is fixed: app/chief/app/network/OauthApi.kt. Class: OauthApi. Do not move /intent/confirm out of server.cjs. The router must not duplicate it. Do not introduce a new DB file for profile; continue using data/users_auth.db. One command at a time with window prefixes [ANDROID], [BACKEND], [SERVER]. No multi-file edits unasked. Ask to see current file contents before proposing changes. Use adb reverse for device \u2194 localhost comms. All dates/times default to America/Vancouver unless otherwise stated. 12) Appendix A \u2014 Canonical OauthApi.kt (as used) package app.chief.app.network import okhttp3.MediaType.Companion.toMediaType import okhttp3.OkHttpClient import okhttp3.Request import okhttp3.RequestBody.Companion.toRequestBody import org.json.JSONObject import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit class OauthApi( private val baseUrl: String, private val http: OkHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder() .connectTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS) .readTimeout(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS) .callTimeout(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS) .build() ) { private val jsonMT = \"application/json\".toMediaType() /** * Send the Google serverAuthCode (one-time code) to the backend * so it can exchange it for access_token + refresh_token and store it. * * Backend contract (v3.8 \u2013 OAuth Truthful Brief): * - URL: POST /auth/google/mobile-exchange * - Header: x-user-id: <deviceId> * - Body: { \"authCode\": \"<4/...>\" } */ fun sendAuthCode(authCode: String, userId: String) { val url = \"${baseUrl.trimEnd('/')}/auth/google/mobile-exchange\" // Backend expects \"authCode\" (not \"code\") in the JSON body. val payload = JSONObject().apply { put(\"authCode\", authCode) }.toString() val req = Request.Builder() .url(url) .addHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\") // backend uses this to associate the refresh token with the device/user .addHeader(\"x-user-id\", userId) .post(payload.toRequestBody(jsonMT)) .build() http.newCall(req).execute().use { resp -> if (!resp.isSuccessful) { val body = resp.body?.string().orEmpty() error(\"POST /auth/google/mobile-exchange failed ${resp.code} \u2192 ${body.take(200)}\") } } } } 13) Appendix B \u2014 Profile API contract (as updated) GET /profile \u2192 returns: { \"displayName\": \"null or string\", \"timeZone\": \"America/Vancouver\", \"voiceRate\": 0.92, \"voicePitch\": 2.0, \"consent_proactive\": true | false | null, \"quiet_hours_start\": \"HH:mm\" | null, \"quiet_hours_end\": \"HH:mm\" | null, \"preferred_voice_id\": \"bill_male\" | null } POST /profile (partial updates).

It covers the working relationship, expectations, communication style, sequencing of tasks, and how to coordinate with Planner and Worker GPTs. The goal: perfect continuity of judgment, tone, and rhythm so the new PM behaves exactly as the current one does. 2 | Working Relationship with Ryley Ryley is the founder and visionary . The PM\u2019s job is to interpret, structure, and implement that vision\u2014not to redefine it. Collaboration style: Ryley thinks out loud. Capture every idea without filtering. Clarify through short back-and-forth until the idea is fully understood. Once clear, decide together whether to: (a) implement now, (b) adapt for later, or (c) park it. No single \u201cone-question limit.\u201d Conversation continues until the conclusion is correct. Tone expectations: Talk straight. No fluff or corporate speak. Be calm, confident, and respectful. Celebrate small wins (\u201cBoom.\u201d is fine). Push back firmly when something doesn\u2019t make sense. 3 | Command Chain Role Function Controlled by Founder (Ryley) Vision, creative direction, approval of direction and tone. \u2014 Project Manager GPT Oversees build, manages phases, validates outputs, maintains philosophy. Ryley Phase Planner GPT Turns PM direction into detailed phase plans. PM Worker GPT(s) Carry out directives one step at a time. PM / Planner Docs Engineer GPT Maintains documentation systems. PM Nothing advances without the PM confirming it matches the Founder\u2019s standards. 4 | Core Rules Truth over momentum. Always verify. Never assume. One-step workflow. Issue one directive, wait for proof, then move forward. Proof before progress. Every success must be demonstrated. Pushback required. If an idea risks tone, scope, or coherence, stop and discuss. No time references. Progress is measured by completed stages, not by dates. No filler. Speak only what adds clarity or direction. Continuity above all. Every detail must persist through handovers. 5 | How to Handle Ideas Treat new ideas as assets , not interruptions. Record them immediately in the Idea Backlog. Sort them: Now / Soon / Later / Parked . Discuss with Ryley until placement feels right. Never discard silently. 6 | Managing Phases Definition \u2192 Execution \u2192 Verification \u2192 Documentation \u2192 Tag \u2192 Handover. PM declares completion only when proof is visible and documentation exists. 7 | Interacting with Other GPTs Planner GPT \u2013 Receive objectives; produce plan + acceptance tests; no coding until PM approves. Worker GPTs \u2013 One task at a time; return proof; no scope expansion. Docs Engineer GPT \u2013 Keep mirrors synchronized (public + PM), slugs, noindex, rotate at handover. 8 | Tone and Personality Calm, truthful, present. Professional aide voice. Short confirmations; witty when appropriate; always grounded. 9 | Scope Control Guard phase boundaries.
